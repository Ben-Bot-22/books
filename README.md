## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

1) When implementing the modal form to collect user data, I learned that using the CSS visibility property hides buttons underneath.  This was easy to debug with Chrome developer tools.  

2) The checkbox label uses the "for" attribute to match the checkbox "id" attribute.  This allows the user to click the text and affect the checkbox.

3) I used [data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) to identify the DOM element with the array index.  This allowed the user to remove books from the library.  To ensure the array indexes (in the DOM) remained accurate, I reloaded the books every time an element was removed.
